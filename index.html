<h1>MY PORTFOLIO</h1>
<h2><u>About me</u></h2>
<p class="main.text">
<h3>MY BACKGROUND</h3>
  <div class="cat">
<p class="main-text">I knew I existed with a reason and that the life held a <strong>better
meaning for me in store</strong>. I knew this the moment I joined campus...Before then,
 I did not know the true meaning of education. My life in Nakeel High school was
  a joke or should I say "I did my best to go to university?". HAhaha, this is
   where I did Procurement as my major. <strong>Kibiko Primary school</strong> is where
   the journey to my life began...You can't get to the top without beginning from the bottom.
   With all this, I still felt I needed to do more, something that I felt because I
    "<em>loved playing with computers</em>" And that is how I found myself at
     <em>Morings school</em> after having been introduced by a good friend of mine.
