<h3>MY BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>
  <div class="cat">

I did not  hate my life or who I was because i knew life held
another meaning for me in store.<strong>"why me"</strong> was the exact word.
 So, Inthe children's home, is where i grew up since the age of 15. There was
a school in the home, so that is where i studied my primary level. Then after
i joined a boarding school at Nakeel <strong>High school</strong>. My school
 fees was being funded by a
good samaritan who came to visit the home. I had to blend in with the
other students and for sure it taught me alot. After having done.<br>
<p>I had to <em>look for a job</em> and help myself as well as we
were not to be allowed in the home after high school level. God is good
I was able to take a <strong>procurement course</strong> in UoN for 2 years.
It wasnice, though had realised that i loved thing  to do with computer, so
my good samaritan decided to giveme what I wanted, <em>'playing with
  computers'</em>..So he suggested Moringa School for me and After cheking
   it on website,I fall in love That is all about my sweet background.
