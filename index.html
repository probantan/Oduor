<h2><u>About me</u></h2>
<p class="main.text">
<h3>MY BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>
  <div class="cat">
I knew I existed with a reason and that the life had a better
meaning for me in store. I knew this the moment I joined campus...Before then,
 I did not know the true meaning of life. My life in Nakeel High school was
  a joke or should I say "I did my best to go to university"
   where I did Procurement as my major. Kibiko Primary school is where
   the journey to my life began...You can't get to the top without beginning from the bottom.
   With all this, I still felt I needed to do more,something that I felt because I
    "loved playing with computers" And that is how I found myself at
     Morings school after having been introduced by a good friend of mine.
